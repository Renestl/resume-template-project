					<p>Dear Commissioner Gordon</p>
					<p>Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.No guns, no killing. The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them. Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages.</p>
					<p>I'm not wearing hockey pads. Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended. Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.</p>
					<p>The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them. Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. It's ends here. It was a dog. It was a big dog. Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. This isn't a car.</p>
					<p>I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. My anger outweights my guilt. Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages.</p>
					<p>I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. Swear to me! I'm Batman</p>
